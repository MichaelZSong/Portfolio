            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Overview&#58;</h1>
            <p>MedicApp was a four-week team project in the course Interface Design. The goal was to design a smartphone
                application and create a functional prototype for the interactive system and a website showcasing the
                application to its potential users. The project tested our design principles and the components of
                usability we have learned using any UI prototyping tools. We picked Axure due to its flexibility to
                implement animations and statements like conditionals and loops.</p>

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">First Step&#58;</h1>
            <p>During our group discussion, we were pretty interested in the idea of an application for suggesting
                over-the-counter medicines in a foreign country. We agreed that this idea is useful for anyone moving to
                another country for either work or study. From there, we created the first set of mockups and a scenario
                for our users. On his first night in China, Danial eats a big meal and starts to feel weird. After
                checking on MedicApp he finds Jianwei Xiaoshi Tablets as an alternative to Jamieson Chewable Probiotic.

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">The Revision&#58;</h1>
            <p>After completing the initial interface, we realized an important issue â€” we have way too many buttons on
                the screen, making it nearly impossible to add interactive elements as the user flow would be way too
                complicated for the project. Therefore, I took on the main interface design role and prepared a fully
                revamped MedicApp interface that is way more straightforward and user-friendly in Figure 2. With the
                integration of a predictive search function to reduce the number of buttons, the new design has a much
                simpler user flow. We all agreed that this was a step in the right direction. I also fine-tuned the
                animations to make the prototype feel more like an actual application.

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Final Mockup&#58;</h1>
            <p>While the revised mockup has a much more streamlined experience for our users, some more problems arose
                as we conducted our second usability testing. Some testers were not a fan of the colours I used in this
                application, they think that it looks like a video game rather than giving out suggestions for medicines
                and lacks a professional feeling to it. Some testers suggested a pharmacy list view to combine with the
                map view we currently have. They also suggested adding more shadows around some elements of the
                application to make it look more modern. Based on the feedback, I made some further improvements to
                MedicApp and produced the final mockup in Figure 3.

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Conclusion&#58;</h1>
            <p>At the end of the semester, we presented the <a
                    href="https://zpggw2.axshare.com/#id=st616q&p=page_1&sc=2&c=1" class="link" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">final MedicApp mockup</a> and its product <a
                    href="https://cxbbwa.axshare.com/#id=5qnd15&p=medicapp&c=1" class="link" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">product website</a> to our instructors. They were really satisfied with
                the outcome of our project, as well as how we were able to drastically improve the interface based on
                their feedback, and we were able to overcome all the difficulties related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                Therefore, I consider this a successful project.</p>
