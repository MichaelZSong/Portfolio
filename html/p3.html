            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Overview&#58;</h1>
            <p>The Thunder game interface design was a ten-week team project in the course Interaction Design Methods.
                We were told to get in touch with an organization or company, familiarize them through meetings and
                researches, then analyze their design problem to deliver a solution for the problem at the end. This
                project examined our concepts of design practice and the related design methods. After reaching out to
                many organizations, we eventually decided on working with the IMU Studios team.</p>

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Research Phase&#58;</h1>
            <p>After deciding on our partner organization, we needed to get to know them. Therefore, we arranged a
                meeting with IMU Studios' founder, Robert Strutin. Although we had to use Discord to conduct the meeting
                due to COVID-19 restrictions, it went really well because Robert was extremely polite to us and
                explained to us his game and how he got to where he is right now. This meeting was very effective and
                laid out a strong foundation for our research of his company.</p>

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Posters&#58;</h1>
            <p>After the meeting, my partners and I started to organize the information we collected from the meeting. I
                was also in charge of the design of the posters. Once I went through their company website and the
                videos of their game development progress multiple times, I was able to establish a clear understanding
                of their game Thunder: Throne Wars and create two posters in Figure 1 to outline our project.</p>

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">User Journey Map&#58;</h1>
            <p>To figure out the process that the player has to go through in the game, we set up another meeting with
                the IMU Studios team. Different from last time, this meeting is a participatory workshop with three
                activities. The activities helped align us with the team in terms of the menus, colours, and the style
                of the interface elements they have in mind. We settled on the idea of making the start menu interface
                for them because it will help push their game forward to the next stage of development. The user journey
                map in Figure 2 was then created to pitch the idea to our instructors.</p>

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">The Game Interface&#58;</h1>
            <p>With the approval from our course instructors, we started to move forward towards our final concept
                mockup design. We wanted to provide Thunder: Throne Wars with a more consistent design direction, such
                as creating a hierarchy between elements, a cohesive theme and a solid colour palette. We also wanted to
                create designs that can be polished and built on by future art directors. Furthermore, with tons of new
                information to take in, such as in-game mechanics, events, items, characters, we wanted to display
                information only when required or the player wants to view it. With those things in mind, I created a
                test interface in Figure 3. However, I quickly realized that it looks too blend since it doesn't have
                any unique elements. As a result, I restarted the progress with a more innovative approach.</p>

            <img src="../img/p3_final.png" alt="Thunder Game World Spawn Interface" height="1920" width="1200"
                class="project-image-four p3">

        <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="-200" data-aos-anchor-placement="top-center">

            <p>With a brand new design strategy, I carefully constructed the interfaces with vector elements I created
                from scratch as well as concept arts from the previous game artists. As things were going well, another
                problem emerged when I started to make the choose spawn menu â€” Thunder doesn't have a finished map yet.
                Thus I had to utilize a placeholder for the map itself to prepare the interface before they finish the
                final map. Even though I was not able to use the actual game world map, I am still relatively satisfied
                with the finished interface in Figure 4.</p>

            <h1 class="paragraph-headings">Conclusion&#58;</h1>
            <p>My teammates were pleased with the nine pages of interface mockup I produced. I also presented our mockup
                to our partner organization, explaining the details and the functions of various elements and thanked
                them for the willingness to help us in this project. They were also satisfied with the revamped game
                interface I delivered to them. Because of that, this was a very successful project. You can <a
